CUCUMBER FRAMEWORK
==================

1.Pre defined Framework
     Junit (TDD - Test Driven Framework)
     TestNG (TDD - Test Driven Framework)
     Cucumber(BDD -Behavior Driven Framework)

2.User defined Framework
     Data Driven Framework
     Keyword Driven Framework
     Hydrid Driven Framework

What is Difference b/w TTD vs BDD?

  1. In TTD we we will createe the Multiple testcases and generate the testng.xml file and 
     execute the Testcases in Testng.xml file and it will generate the Reports. Non-Technical people can not understand this

  2. In BDD We will create the Feature file, based on Feature file we will create Test Scenarios and Test cases.
     and we will execute the Testcases using  TestRunner Class this is also called as Juint Class. Non-Technical people also understand this 
     BDD Framework is common English language

CUCUMBER IMPLEMENTATION
=======================

1. First we need CUCUMBER Plugin in Eclipse
   Go to Eclipse Marketplace -> Search for Cucumber and select =>Cucumber eclipse plugin 0.0.23

  What is Feature File?
    
     Feature file contains all the Features of an Application

      Application : ACEGRADES
         Features : Login, Teacher Login, Parent Login, Student Login (These all are Features)
                    We will create  Step Definations using this Feature Files

To Specify steps in Feature file we need to use special language called Gherkin
Feature
Scenario
Given
When
And 
Then


Given

   we need to specify "Pre-requisites" 

When/And

    We need to specify Steps
Then
 
    We need to Expected   

CUCUMBER OPTIONS
================
1. features = The path of the Feature File
2. glue = Path of the step definations files
3. format= To generate defferent types of reporting
4. monochrome=display the console  output in a proper readable format
5. strict = It will check if any step is not defined in step defination file
6. dryRun = To check the mapping is proper between feature file and step def file

  How to Comment Feature File using "#" Symbol

  Parameters passing using Regular Expression

DATA DRIVEN TESTNG IN CUCUMBER
-------------------------------
1. Data Driven testing can be donw using Scenario Outline and Examples Keyword
2. Using Data Table with Single Input(We will use List variable)
3. Using Data Table with Header (We will use Map variable)

    What is difference between Scenario and Scenario Outline?

Tags and Hooks in Cucumber
=========================

   By using tagging feature we can ececutes/ignores specific test scenario from featue file

Hooks:-
=====
  
    I have 3 Scenarios are there. Each and Every scenario i want to execute Setup() method and After 3 Scenarios i want to execute TearDown() Method.

Example:-

        setUp()                                setUp()                      setUp()
    
       Scenario :1                            Scenario :2                   Scenario :3

       tearDown()                              tearDown()                    tearDown()
